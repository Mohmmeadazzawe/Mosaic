We aspire to a society whose members enjoy all their rights and live a dignified life. We seek to link relief work with development to spread awareness, culture, and build a better future. Therefore, we focus on providing urgent aid, developing skills through training programs, and providing health and psychological care, while promoting a culture of tolerance among all groups. We also work on establishing service investment projects that support the funding of our programs and achieve sustainable community development.",
